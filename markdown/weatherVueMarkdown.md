# Weather Imp (Vue)

I made this app to learn more about Vue, the composition API and Bootstrap. It is a conversion of my React [Weather Imp](https://github.com/JonathanDPotter/weather-api) project into a Vue project. The back-end repo is [here](https://github.com/JonathanDPotter/weather-api-back), and it is hosted on Heroku [here](https://weather-l95e66yd3-jonathandpotter.vercel.app/).

## Technologies Used

This app was written in Typescript with Vue. I used Vuex for state management, Bootstrap and SASS for styling and Axios for API
calls.

## Functionality

On the home page a user can choose to use their device location or enter a US zip code. The home page displays the current weather conditions for that location. A user can navigate to the three-day forecast or hourly forecast pages to get those forecasts as well.
