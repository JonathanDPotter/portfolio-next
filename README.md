## Welcome to my personal portfolio

This app is a personal website that links to my github, linkedIn, and many hosted projects that I have developed. It is hosted on Vercel [here](https://portfolio-kappa-black-98.vercel.app/).

## Technologies used

This site was written in typescript with react and does not utilize a
back-end. After completing it in react as a single-page-app, I decided to convert it to a multi-page server-side rendered next.js app. I would probably structure it a little differently if I were to write it in next.js from the beggining, but converting it was a good introduction to next.js and using scss modules. I use scss for styling, the context api for global state management, react-intersection-observer for scroll events, react-markdown to display markdown, react-pdf to display my resume, react-modal to show modals, uuid for element keys, and fontawesome for icons.

## Functionality

On opening the home page, the user is presented with navigation buttons to choose what part of the site to go to. The projects page has descriptions and photos of my projects, with links to the source code and hosted apps. The about me page has a quick description of me, and a few photo slideshows. The resume page displays a PDF of my resume and allows users to download it. The contact page displays my email address, and the about page contains a description of the site. A hamburger menu at the top contains a link to my github and linkedIn profiles and a color theme chooser.
